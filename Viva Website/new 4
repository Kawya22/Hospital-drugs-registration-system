Machine design is an important part of engineering applications.	
Machine is the devise that comprises of the stationary parts and moving parts combined together to generate, 
transform or utilize the mechanical energy. All the machines are made up of elements or parts and units. 
Each element is a separate part of the machine and it may have to be designed separately and in assembly. 
Each element in turn can be a complete part or made up of several small pieces which are joined together by riveting, welding etc. 
Several machine parts are assembled together to form what we call as complete machine.

		1) Lathe: It utilizes mechanical energy to cut the metals. The other types of machine tools also perform the same task.
		2) Turbines: They produce mechanical energy.
		3) Compressors: They use mechanical energy to compress the air.
